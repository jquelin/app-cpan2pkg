=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Purpose of the program

This script is a glue application around cpan2dist, interacting with
your upstream distribution. When calling this script, it will:

=over 4

=item *

check whether it's alrady packaged by your vendor, and install from it
if that's the case.

=item *

otherwise, build a native package with cpan2dist - this implies that
there is a working C<CPANPLUS::Dist> backend for your OS.

=item *

once built, import the module in upstream repository.

=item *

then submit module to upstream buildsystem.

=back

And this, while dealing with dependencies, all the way long, repeating
steps over and over as needed.

Read L<this blog entry|http://jquelin.blogspot.com/2009/01/cpan-modules-native-linux-
packages.html> for this module rationale.




=head2 How to use

See the options below (or C<cpan2pkg --help>) for more information on
how to launch the script. Once launched, you will get a curses
application, with a list on the left and some text on the right.

The left list contains all the modules currently being built / installed
/ worked upon. You can get back to this list at any time by hitting the
F2 key. A plus (+) prefix means that module is available locally. A
minus (-) means that module is not yet available locally. A question
mark (?) prefix means that module needs help and that user should do
something before continuing.

The right list contains details on a given module: name, missing
prereqs, and everything being done for this module. One can change the
module shown by hitting the Enter key in the left list.

You can hit C<Ctrl+Q> at any time to quit the application. This will
also terminate all operations currently running.
